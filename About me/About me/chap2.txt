- Chapter 2 -
As usual I went to the library after school and spread my notebook.
It's been a month since I saw Akari.
A horrible thought often passed around my mind but I tried to not look at it.
"(She will come back.)"
I kept telling myself and tooka pen and studied everyday at library until the library closes.
I closed my eyes and remembered the time she told me something once.
That was when Akari first told me a little about her conditions.
"I might not come to school anymore, someday soon."
She told me as if she just talked to herself.
I did not say anything and she continued.
"Even so, I hope you still wait for me here."
"..."
I thought a second and opened my mouth.
"Until you come?"
I stopped my pen and looked up her.
She was showing her back against the chair in front of me.
Taking a while, she answered.
"Until you find me."
"...What do you mean?"
She did not say anything and faced to me with her usual smile.
"Nothing!"
I opened my eyes and looked at the window.
It was starting to rain. My phone showed me that there will be a thunder storm.
("It's like the day I met her for the first time.")
Windy and rainy.
There was not thunder then and somehow I felt so worried about her.
"(Until I find her...)"
The day after the thunderstorm, it was announced in school that Akari passed away last night.
