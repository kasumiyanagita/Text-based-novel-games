- Chapter 1 -
The girl that talked to me at the library started to come to talk often since the windy and rainy day.
She introduced herself as Akari Tojo.
She is very cheerful and talkative.
"Hey, Toshi. Are you studying?"
My name is Toshihito Hujiwara. She likes to call me Toshi.
"Yeah, it's physics. Just a homework."
Akari looked at my notebook and curiously followed every of my notes.
"You are very good at making notes. They all look pretty and explains so well."
"You don't even know what I'm studying."
She laughed and said "Well, kind boy does not say those."
She gave me back my notebook and sat on the chair in front of me.
"Don't you want to study yours now?"
"It's the time to study literature, Toshi."
"It's always the time for books for you..."
Saying so, she happily stood up and went to find a book.
Akari had a congenital desease and often could not join the class.
So even she is a year older than me, she barely attended the classes that I've done in this school.
I also only see her after school like twice a week.
Her mother worried her and gave her a lot of books since she was little.
She did not like studying taking lecture and solving the problems on exams but she liked reading almost all kinds of books, ...except physics.
"Hehe, I got this book. Look, Toshi."
She showed me a physics book that has explaination and problem at the same time.
"That looks good."
After I said so, she smiled and sat next to me.
Helping her study at library a few times a week was getting our usual.
"Yes, that's correct."
"Yay!"
Akari often showed her smile whenever tiny good things happen.
Solving a single physics question was also one of them and I kind of liked seeing her happy like that.
But around that it's beeing a year since Akari and I met, she barely came to library nor school.
