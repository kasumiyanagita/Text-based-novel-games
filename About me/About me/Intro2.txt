- Prologue 2 -
On the day of strongly raining day, I met her.
"Excuse me, the library is closing soon."
"Oh, sorry"
Looking at the clock, it showed 5 pm.
"(I forgot that the library closes at 5 today...)"
Closing my notebook and having the book that I was reading in my hand, she talked to me.
"Mary's rain, I like the book too."
Looking up to her, she was smiling quietly.
I answer just simply, with fake smile.
"Haha, yeah this book is nice huh."
Regardless of me trying to leave here, she continues.
"You often come here, right?"
"...Yes."
Because of her unexpected words, I took a while to respond.
"I like it too. How far did you read so far?"
"Almost the end, around where Mary finds her grandfather's letter in an old book."
This book was just a random book that I found near this month's recomendation shelf. This book was there as if it was hiding befind the shelf.
"Ah, I see. I hope you enjoy rest of the story."
She added a common sentence and smiled nicely again.
"(Strange)"
As a guy that never get talked to like this, I felt a bit awkward but I felt her atmosphere made the uncomfotable feeling softer.
"Thank you."
After saying so, I took my backpack and left the library.
It was the day that rains so hard with harsh wind.
